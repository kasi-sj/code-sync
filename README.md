<h1 align="center" id="title">CodeSync Project</h1>
<p id="description">  CodeCollab is a comprehensive project that includes a feature-rich code editor, designed to offer functionalities similar to VS Code. The project encompasses a robust set of features, including editing, opening, listing, creating, managing, and saving files and folders. Additionally, it integrates a basic terminal. The standout feature of CodeCollab is its collaborative editing capability, which leverages socket.io for real-time communication, allowing multiple users to work on the same codebase simultaneously.

<h2>üìÅ Project Structure</h2>

This repository consists of three main components:

    Backend: Built with Ruby on Rails (user authentication and management)
    Frontend: Built with Next.js 
    Desktop: Built with Tauri (system API's)
<p>The backend for user management in CodeCollab is reused from another project. For detailed information about the backend implementation, please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/kasi-sj/TrackMe/blob/main/track-me-backend/README.md">Backend README</a> of the original project.</p>

<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Built With</h2>

Technologies used in the project:

    Backend: Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL
    Frontend: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Next UI , monaco-editor , primereact terminal
    Desktop: Tauri

<h2>üîß Backend Implementation</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Operation Transformation:</strong> Ensures consistency of edits made by multiple users in real-time using server_version and client_version, allowing for smooth collaborative editing.</li>
  <li><strong>Cursor Management:</strong> Tracks and updates cursor positions for all users, providing a seamless collaborative experience.</li>
  <li><strong>Socket Channel:</strong> Utilizes socket channels for sending and receiving updates efficiently.</li>
  <li><strong>Architecture:</strong> 
    <ul>
      <li>Multiple users connect to a single server (root server) that acts as the single source of truth.</li>
      <li>The root server sends updates to all connected users, ensuring consistency.</li>
      <li>Socket.io is used for managing connections and real-time communication.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>File Management Channels:</strong> 
    <ul>
      <li>A single channel is created by the host (root server) for overall file management.</li>
      <li>Separate channels are created by the host for each file that is in editing mode, allowing for focused updates and edits.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Terminal Integration:</strong> The terminal is connected by running system commands through a Rust API. Input and output streams are transferred from the frontend to the backend, enabling seamless command execution.</li>
</ul>
